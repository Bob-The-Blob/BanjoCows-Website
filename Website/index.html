	<p>Welcome the official BanjoCows website. This website is made from scratch and will have everything from BanjoCows. Also, the link to our game, Cheese Hunt, is <a href="https://banjocows.itch.io/cheese-hunt" target="_blank">here</a>. BanjoCows is an indie software group which me and a few friends have made. The game currently being made is Cheese Hunt, a small 2d survival game. We have plans for other stuff including plans for this website. You can subscribe to my YouTube channel at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8e7fXfrrjuJWj_2tKBUcWg" target="_blank">BOB THE BLOB</a> to stay updated.</p>
	<p>Also, click on this link for Honey because why not. I saw it and just decided to put it here. <a href="https://www.joinhoney.com/ref/pqe4wbl" target="_blank">Honey link.</a></p>
