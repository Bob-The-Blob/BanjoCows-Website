	<h1>BanjoCows</h1>
	<p><b>BanjoCows</b> is the name of the company that we release software under. Think of it as a software/game dev studio. It was satrted in 2017 when we decided to make video games. Currently our only game is <a href="cheese hunt.html"><b>Cheese Hunt</b></a> and it gets updated regularly. We do have plans to expand and to begin work on other games and programs. You can also play our games on this website without having to download them.</p>
