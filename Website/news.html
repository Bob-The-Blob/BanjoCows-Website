	<h1>Latest News 5/6/2020</h1>
	<p>There is now a news section for this website, so now I can release a new article everytime there is something new. The news section will be built up and more things will be added like each article having its own page. This is a big development for the website because now there is a purpose to come back here other than playing our games. You can come to this page and see if there is anything new. I might add an email thng if continue to make this website better and fill it wih more stuff. I have also began making a 3d game that uses the distortion of gravity. I have been lazy in making videos for my channel and for updating this website and Cheese Hunt, but I hope that I can be not as lazy in the furture. Anyway that's all for now!</p>
