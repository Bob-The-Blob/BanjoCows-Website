	<p>Cheese Hunt is an 2d, indie strategy/survival game where you, as a mouse, have to collect cheese and score while not being killed by the cat. The game began production in 2018 and has been worked on from time to time.Currenty the game is nearing completion and is on Alpha 0.5, The Score Rework Update. In this update, I redid the way score worked and was calculated. I also changed the way you level up.</p>
